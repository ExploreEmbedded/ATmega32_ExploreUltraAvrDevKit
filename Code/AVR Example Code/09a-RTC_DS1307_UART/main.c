 * File:   main.c
 * Version: 16.0
 * Author: ExploreEmbedded
 * Website: http://www.exploreembedded.com/wiki
 * Description: This file contains the program to read and write RTC(DS1307) date and time, 
 *              Date and time is set only once in the beginning after that it is continously read and transmitted on UART

The libraries have been tested on ExploreEmbedded development boards. We strongly believe that the
library works on any of development boards for respective controllers. However, ExploreEmbedded
disclaims any kind of hardware failure resulting out of usage of libraries, directly or indirectly.
Files may be subject to change without prior notice. The revision history contains the information
related to updates.
